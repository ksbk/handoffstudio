# apps/backend (placeholder)

This directory is reserved for the future Django backend.

Planned scope:

- Django project/app bootstrap
- API endpoints and service-layer logic
- Auth, admin, and background jobs
- Deployment configuration separated from `apps/web`

Current status: placeholder only (no runtime code yet).
