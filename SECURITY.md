# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Report privately by contacting the project maintainer through a private channel and include:

- Affected file/path
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Scope

Security reports should focus on:

- Build/release pipeline risk
- Dependency and script safety
- Header and deployment policy regressions
- Data handling risks in code or docs

## Response

Best effort triage is performed as quickly as possible. High-impact issues are prioritized first.
