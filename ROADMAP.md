# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Static Launch (Now)

- Multi-page static marketing website
- Config-driven brand/content updates
- Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Intake form external link + email fallback

## Phase 2: Django Lead Ops

- Django app for lead intake persistence
- Admin triage dashboard
- Email notifications and status workflows
- Basic analytics around intake quality and conversion

## Phase 3: Service Ops Expansion

- Pricing calculators
- Client portal and delivery status views
- Optional API surface for integrations

## Suggested Repository Boundary

- Keep static marketing site deployable independently
- Introduce Django backend in a separate folder/repo to avoid release coupling
