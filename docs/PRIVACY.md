# Privacy-by-Design Notes

## Public Identity

- Use brand identity only on public pages
- Avoid exposing personal identity in marketing copy
- Keep legal identity only where required (billing/compliance)

## Intake and Communication

- Prefer brand email and brand intake endpoints
- Collect only information needed for scoping and delivery

## Metadata Hygiene

- Remove unnecessary author metadata from deliverables when feasible
- Avoid embedding personal identifiers in file properties and exports
- Keep preview assets synthetic and free of client/personal identifiers
- Treat generated screenshots as disposable artifacts (not source-of-truth content)

## Operational Principle

Privacy is a default constraint in copy, tooling, and delivery workflows.
